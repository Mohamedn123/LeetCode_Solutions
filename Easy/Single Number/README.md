Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and without using extra memory?

## Example 1:


```python
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

## Example 2:

```python
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```
